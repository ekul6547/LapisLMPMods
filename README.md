# Instructions
> If you want easier updating, look below
1) Click the "Clone or Download" button
2) Download Zip
3) Copy contents of GameData folder to KSP GameData folder

# Updater
I have created a couple of bat files which automatically download all the mod files when run.
Place them in the main game files folder (the folder with the .exe file)
> Git is REQUIRED for them to function:
> https://git-scm.com/downloads
- The LMPMods_Update.bat will download any new mods, and update any files in the GameData.
- The LMPMods_Reset.bat will delete all files in the .git and GameData folders, except the default "Squad" and "SquadExpansion" folders.

If anything goes wrong, contact me on the discord.
